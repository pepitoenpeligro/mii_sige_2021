# Deep Learning & Machine Learning

![](sige_icon.png)

This repository contains the works of the subject SIGE (Sistemas de Información para la Gestión en la Empresa). This subject focuses on machine learning and deep learning algorithms for use in business and other fields.

The content of the pdfs is in Spanish, but the scripts that generate the content are universal.



- `machine_learning_for_classification` contains a pre-processing and a study of the CERN data set on the Higgs boson, to subsequently apply different machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as KNN, Decisieon Trees or neural networks themselves. Finally, a balancing process and a detailed study of the final results are carried out.

- `deep_learning_for_classification` contains a study on a set of 'fake news' from Reddit. Convolutional neural networks and different optmisation techniques, as well as transfer learning, are applied to this study.
